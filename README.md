Real time train tracker -- Harvard Square to Braintree on the MBTA Red Line

Description: This is a map of all the train stops on my high school commute between Harvard and Braintree on the MBTA Red Line. To run the program, click the button in the upper left. This project demonstrates my ability to move markers on a map and work with maps & data from external sources. It utilizes JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

Improvements made: First, I re-centered the map around the Shawmut T stop and changed the zoom to 10.5. Then, I changed the wording of the button. Then, I added train stops to comprise my train commute during high school (rather than bus stops).

Installation: Run from the browser! (Leave images in the folder where they are stored).

Usage: Open index.html in your browser, and click the button in the top to get started!

Support: Email me! castaldo.matthew@gmail.com

Roadmap: Adding trains in real time. Also, there is  a stoppage of service currently between Braintree and Quincy Center currently (according to my mom, I live in California now!). So, it would be fun to map the busses between those stops to try and track total commuite time.
