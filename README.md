Train Commute Tracker during my High School days!

This is a map of all the train stops on my high school commute between Harvard and Braintree on the MBTA Red Line. To run the program, click the button in the upper left.

Improvements made:

Re-centered the map around the Shawmut T stop and changed the zoom to 10.5
Changed wording on button
Added additional stops to comprise my entire commuite during high school

Planned/future improvements:

Adding trains in real time
There is also a stop currently between Braintree and Quincy Center currently (according to my mom, I live in California now!). So, it would be fun to map the busses between those stops to try and track total commuite time.
